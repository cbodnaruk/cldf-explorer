# CLDF Explorer
## Background
As part of a recent deep dive into data accessibility practices in Bayesian phylolinguistics, I found that while data was often shared in the CLDF format, I was unable to find a simple tool to explore large CLDF datasets to aid in the review of language data and cognate judgements. To rectify this and make large CLDF datasets easier to read for a human, CLDF Explorer allows users to open full datasets, browse, filter, and search individual tables, and view links between tables.
